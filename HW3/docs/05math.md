# Logarithms

Add to multiple

Subtract to divide.

# Maths: Gasussians


# Maths: Probabi;ity Theory

- Confidence $C$ to see an event at prob.  $p$ after $n$ trials $C = (1 - p)^n$.
  - So $n = \frac{log(1-C)}{log(1-p)}$
- If we have any tricks for order examples best to worst, we can do a binary chop
  - So $n = log_2\left( \frac{log(1-C)}{log(1-p)}\right)$
- Guassians
