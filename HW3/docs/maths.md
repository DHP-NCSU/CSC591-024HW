here are two boxes with a set of numbers of symols. are the same? can we fuse them rand reason about fewer boxes?

## non-numerics

- centrality = mid= mode
= -diversity = entropy

## Distributions

One number, N numbers, 
- centrality = mean 
- diversty = stamdard deviation 

computing sd
- welford
- nonparametric: median, (90=10)/2.58 (only keep some, resort when needed)

- are they distinguishable? significance
  - quick and nasty; cohen's D
  - more considered: bootstrap (nonparametric)
- are they different, enough?
  - effect size: cliffs delta

that's for two distributions.
- for n, we do a top down clustering (scott-knott)
