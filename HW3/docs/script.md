### SE Tut
- [ ] Programms don't just program. Where does the time go.
- [ ] Testing
  - "If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.". "Writing code without tests is like driving a car with your eyes closed."
  - debugging: break points, tracing
  - test suites, watch
  - formal, whitebox, blackbox, fuzzing
  - TDD
  - massive scale up, the Google story
- [ ] Heuristics: bob's ruleof5, sven's rule (config cris),
- [ ] Documentation: markdown,   doc generation, dpc strings, type hints
- [ ] Types, static analysis, Haskell, RUST
- [ ] Little languages
  - csv headers, regular expressions, makefiles
  - separate mechanism from policy (my little language)
- [ ] Makefiles, dependanceies, build structures, automate workflows
- [ ] LLMs (won't replace programmers). Link: IEEE Software article.
